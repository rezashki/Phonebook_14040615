# Tasks: Phonebook App Main Components

**Input**: Design documents from `F:\Reza Shaki\Github Repos\Phonebook_14040615\specs\001-phonebook-app-main-components\`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. ✓ Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Python Flask backend, React frontend, SQLite database, PyInstaller packaging
2. ✓ Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities (Users, Contacts, Companies, Notices) → model tasks
   → contracts/: auth.md, contacts.md, notices.md → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. ✓ Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, structure
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, API routes, React components
   → Integration: frontend-backend connection, authentication
   → Polish: packaging, documentation, testing
4. ✓ Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. ✓ Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. ✓ Generate dependency graph
7. ✓ Create parallel execution examples
8. ✓ Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests? ✓
   → All entities have models? ✓
   → All endpoints implemented? ✓
9. ✓ Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `backend/` directory
- **Frontend**: `frontend/` directory
- **Shared**: `shared/` directory
- **Packaging**: `packaging/` directory

## Phase 3.1: Setup

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation
### Database Models
- [x] T012 [P] Create User model (data-model.md)

- [x] T018 Implement companies routes (/api/companies/*)
- [x] T019 Implement notices routes (/api/notices/*)
- [x] T020 Implement user management routes (/api/users/*)

### Frontend Components
- [x] T021 [P] Create Login component
- [x] T022 [P] Create Dashboard component
- [x] T023 [P] Create Contacts list component
- [x] T024 [P] Create Companies list component
- [x] T025 [P] Create Notice board component
- [x] T026 [P] Create User management component

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [x] T027 Set up Flask-CORS for frontend-backend communication

- [x] T036 Create launcher script with background server
- [x] T037 Add auto-browser opening functionality
- [x] T038 Implement graceful server shutdown on app exit

## Phase 3.6: Polish & Testing
- [x] T039 [P] Write unit tests for backend models
- [x] T040 [P] Write unit tests for utility functions
- [x] T041 [P] Write React component tests
- [x] T042 [P] Performance testing and optimization
- [x] T043 [P] Update quickstart.md with final instructions
- [x] T044 [P] Create user documentation
- [x] T045 [P] Final integration testing

## Parallel Execution Examples
Run these command groups in parallel for maximum efficiency:

**Group 1 - Setup & Tests:**
```
/execute T001 T004 T005 T006 T007 T008
```

**Group 2 - Models & Components:**
```
/execute T012 T013 T014 T015 T021 T022 T023 T024 T025 T026
```

**Group 3 - Polish Tasks:**
```
/execute T039 T040 T041 T042 T043 T044 T045
```

## Task Completion Checklist
- [x] All contract tests implemented and passing
- [x] All database models created with proper relationships
- [x] All API endpoints implemented and tested
- [x] Frontend components created and integrated
- [x] Authentication and authorization working
- [x] Single instance management implemented
- [x] PyInstaller packaging successful
- [x] Application runs as single .exe file

## Notes
- Tasks marked [P] can be executed in parallel
- Sequential tasks must be completed in order
- All tests should be written before implementation (TDD)
- File paths are relative to project root
- Update task status as you complete them
