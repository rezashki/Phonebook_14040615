# Feature Specification: Phonebook App Main Components

**Feature Branch**: `001-phonebook-app-main-components`  
**Created**: September 8, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "im makeing a an app that has these main component: 1. dashboard 2. phone book that keeps 2.1 .conatcts details 2.2. companies details ( seperately), 3. login for 3 types of users admin, editor, user , 4. user management for admin user . 5 a notice board in dashboard to post for all users to see"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the phonebook application, I want to access a dashboard that provides a centralized view of my contacts and companies, allows me to log in based on my user role (admin, editor, or user), manage users if I'm an admin, and view notices posted by others.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access the dashboard, **Then** they are redirected to the login page.
2. **Given** an admin user is logged in, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they can view the phonebook, manage users, and post notices.
3. **Given** an editor user is logged in, **When** they access the phonebook, **Then** they can view and edit contacts and companies details.
4. **Given** a regular user is logged in, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they can view contacts, companies, and notices but cannot edit or manage users.
5. **Given** an admin user is logged in, **When** they post a notice on the dashboard, **Then** all users can see the notice.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to access restricted features without proper permissions?
- How does the system handle invalid login attempts?
- What occurs if the phonebook has no contacts or companies?
- How are notices displayed if there are many of them?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dashboard accessible after login.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to view and manage contacts details in the phonebook.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to view and manage companies details separately in the phonebook.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide login functionality for three types of users: admin, editor, and user.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow admin users to manage other users.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a notice board in the dashboard for posting notices visible to all users.
- **FR-007**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Contacts**: Represents individual contacts with details like name, phone, email.
- **Companies**: Represents companies with details like name, address, contact person.
- **Users**: Represents system users with roles (admin, editor, user).
- **Notices**: Represents announcements posted on the dashboard.
