# Task Planning: Phone Book Feature

## Task Generation Strategy
- Use `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from contracts, data model, quickstart
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

## Ordering Strategy
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

## Estimated Output
- 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Example Task List

2. Define Contact data model
3. Implement validation logic for Contact

10. Implement PUT /contacts/{id} endpoint
11. Write contract tests for DELETE /contacts/{id}
12. Implement DELETE /contacts/{id} endpoint
13. Write contract tests for GET /contacts/search
14. Implement GET /contacts/search endpoint
15. Write integration tests for user scenarios
16. Implement error handling and logging
17. Write quickstart documentation
18. Review and refactor code for simplicity
19. Validate requirements and acceptance criteria
