## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to store, view, update, and delete contact information (names, phone numbers) in a personal phone book.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an empty phone book, **When** the user adds a new contact, **Then** the contact appears in the list.
2. **Given** a phone book with contacts, **When** the user edits a contact, **Then** the updated information is saved and displayed.
3. **Given** a phone book with contacts, **When** the user deletes a contact, **Then** the contact is removed from the list.
4. **Given** a phone book with contacts, **When** the user searches for a contact by name or number, **Then** matching contacts are shown.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to add a contact with a duplicate phone number? The system should prompt the user that the phone number is already used for contact(s) and display the name(s) of those contact(s).
- How does the system handle invalid phone number formats? The system should prompt the user to enter the phone number in the correct format and prevent saving until valid.
- What if the user tries to delete a contact that does not exist? The system should inform the user that the contact does not exist and no deletion occurs.
- Contacts must be unique by both name and phone number.
- The maximum number of contacts allowed is 50,000.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add new contacts with name and phone number.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to view a list of all contacts.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to edit existing contact information.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to delete contacts.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to search contacts by name or phone number.
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate phone number format when adding or editing contacts.
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent duplicate contacts; contacts must be unique by both name and phone number.
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle errors gracefully when operations fail (e.g., invalid input, contact not found).
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist contact data between sessions.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support a maximum number of contacts of 50,000.

### Key Entities
- **Contact**: Represents an individual entry in the phone book. Key attributes: name (string), phone number (string, validated format). Each contact is unique by both name and phone number.
- **Phone Book**: Collection of contacts. May include metadata such as owner, creation date, etc. The phone book is global and shared among all users; there is no per-user separation.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use specific question for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via username/password
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for 10 years
### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
