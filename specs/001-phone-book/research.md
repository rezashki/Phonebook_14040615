# Phase 0 Research: Phone Book Feature

## Unknowns and Clarifications
- Language/Version: Python 3.11+ or Node.js (decision needed)
- Primary Dependencies: FastAPI, Flask, or Express (decision needed)
- Storage: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or file-based (decision needed)
- Testing: pytest, unittest, or Jest (decision needed)
- Target Platform: Linux server or cross-platform (decision needed)

## Research Tasks
1. Research best language and framework for a CRUD phone book application with up to 50,000 contacts.
2. Research storage options for scalability and reliability.
3. Research validation and error handling best practices for contact data.
4. Research test frameworks and strategies for chosen language.
5. Research logging and observability best practices.

## Findings
### Language/Framework
- Python with FastAPI is recommended for rapid development, strong validation, and async support.
- Node.js with Express is also suitable, especially for JavaScript-centric teams.

### Storage
- SQLite is simple and suitable for small to medium datasets, but PostgreSQL is recommended for scalability and reliability.
- File-based storage is not recommended for concurrent access and large datasets.

### Validation & Error Handling
- Use Pydantic (Python) or Joi (Node.js) for schema validation.
- Always validate phone number format before saving.
- Provide clear error messages for invalid input and failed operations.

### Testing
- Use pytest (Python) or Jest (Node.js) for unit and integration tests.
- Follow TDD: write failing tests before implementation.

### Logging & Observability
- Use structured logging (e.g., Python's logging module or Winston for Node.js).
- Include error context in logs for debugging.

## Decisions
- Language: Python 3.11+
- Framework: FastAPI
- Storage: PostgreSQL
- Testing: pytest
- Platform: Linux server

## Alternatives Considered
- Node.js/Express: Good for JS teams, but Python/FastAPI offers better validation and async support.
- SQLite: Simpler, but less scalable than PostgreSQL.

## Rationale
- Chosen stack offers scalability, reliability, and rapid development. Validation and error handling are robust, and testing is well-supported.
