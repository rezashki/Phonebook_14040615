Project Overview

This project involves building a fully online web application that will be hosted on a cloud server. The app will have the following features:

Frontend: A web app that can be accessed via any modern browser.

Backend: A Node.js API server that communicates with the frontend and manages data in a PostgreSQL database.

Real-time Updates: Optional use of Socket.io to provide real-time updates.

Architecture Diagram

Here’s a high-level view of the system architecture:

Key Components of the Architecture

Frontend (Client):

Technology Stack: React, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios, Socket.io (optional).

Responsibility: Provides the user interface and client-side logic. Communicates with the backend API to fetch or send data.

Components:

UI Components built with React.

State Management using React Router for navigation.

API Requests made using Axios to interact with the backend server.

Real-time Communication (optional) with Socket.io to get live updates.

Backend (API Server):

Technology Stack: Node.js, Express.js, JWT (for authentication), Socket.io (optional).

Responsibility: Manages the app’s API endpoints, handles client requests, performs authentication, and manages business logic.

API Routes: Provides RESTful APIs for all client interactions (CRUD operations).

JWT: Manages user authentication using JSON Web Tokens.

Real-Time Server (optional) using Socket.io for handling real-time communication (like notifications, live updates).

Database:

Technology Stack: PostgreSQL (SQL).

Responsibility: Stores and manages all application data, including user data, settings, and other business-related data.

CRUD Operations: Data is retrieved and updated via API calls made to the backend server.

Security: Database is protected with appropriate user roles, authentication, and encryption.

Hosting:

Server: The entire application (frontend, backend, and database) will be hosted on a cloud-based server (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean).

Deployment: The backend API and database will be hosted on a cloud server, while the frontend React app can be served through a web server (e.g., NGINX, Apache).

Docker: The app will be containerized using Docker to ensure that it runs consistently across different environments. Docker helps in isolating dependencies and simplifying deployment.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment and testing.

Flow of Data

User Authentication: When a user logs in, the frontend sends credentials (username and password) to the backend via an API request. If successful, the backend sends a JWT back, which is used for further authenticated requests.

API Requests: The frontend makes REST API calls (using Axios) to interact with the backend, which processes these requests and interacts with the database. For example:

GET /data: Fetch data from the server.

POST /data: Send data to the server for storage.

Real-Time Communication (Optional): Using Socket.io, the frontend can listen for real-time updates from the backend (e.g., notifications, chat messages, or live data). The backend pushes updates via WebSocket to the frontend in real time.

Database Operations: The backend interacts with the PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data. SQL queries are executed based on the client’s requests.
