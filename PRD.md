Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the web application that will be developed using React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Docker. The app will be hosted on a cloud server and will feature real-time updates and online data synchronization.

2. Features

2.1 User Authentication

Login/Logout: Users must be able to log in to access the application, with JWT used for maintaining authentication.

Registration: New users must be able to register an account with basic information (name, email, password).

Authentication: JWT will be used for authentication. The server will generate and validate tokens for secure access to protected routes.

2.2 Dashboard

A user dashboard will display essential data, such as statistics, user profile, and a navigation panel for accessing different modules.

The dashboard will display cards with key stats (e.g., user activity, system health).

2.3 Modules

Phone Book Module: Allows users to store, retrieve, and manage contact information (e.g., name, phone number, email).

Company Information: Users can add, update, or delete company-related details.

Notice Board: A place for users to post and view company-wide announcements.

Board Members: A module to display and manage information about company board members.

2.4 Real-Time Updates (Optional)

Socket.io integration will enable real-time communication for features like live notifications, chat messages, or live data feeds.

2.5 Data Sync and Storage

All data will be stored in the PostgreSQL database hosted on a cloud server.

Data will be synchronized in real-time via API calls to the backend.

3. User Roles and Permissions

Admin: Full access to all modules and data. Admins can manage users, settings, and system configurations.

Editor: Can modify content and data within the app but cannot manage users or settings.

User: Can view and access the basic features of the app but cannot modify data.

4. Technical Requirements

Frontend:

React for building the UI and handling dynamic data.

Tailwind CSS for styling and rapid UI development.

React Router for routing between pages.

Axios for handling API requests.

Socket.io for real-time communication (optional).

Backend:

Node.js + Express.js for building the API server and handling HTTP requests.

JWT for user authentication and authorization.

Socket.io for real-time communication (optional).

Database:

PostgreSQL for storing structured data (user information, company data, etc.).

Hosting:

Custom server (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean) to host both frontend and backend.

Docker to containerize the app for easy deployment and management.

Security:

Data will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., using database encryption features).

Proper CORS and rate-limiting mechanisms will be implemented to protect the server.

5. Performance Requirements

Scalability: The system should scale to handle a large number of users, especially for API requests and database interactions.

Response Time: API calls should return responses within 2 seconds.

Real-Time Communication: Real-time updates (via Socket.io) should have minimal latency.

6. Deployment and Maintenance

The app will be deployed on a cloud server with Docker for containerization.

CI/CD pipelines will be set up for continuous integration and deployment.

Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) will be used to monitor the serverâ€™s performance.

7. Non-Functional Requirements

Security: The app must be secured against common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF).

Accessibility: The app should be accessible to users with disabilities (WCAG 2.1 compliance).

Usability: The app should have an intuitive interface and be easy to use.

Localization: The app will initially support the English language, but it should be built with future localization in mind.
